RECALL RANK!!!

This is a challenging, memory-like game where a word appears for ONE SECOND and then disappears.
You then have to GUESS THAT WORD!
If you guess right, your score will be increased by the NUMBER OF LETTERS in that word. So, if the word is "table" and you guess it right, your score will be increased by FIVE!!!

BUT...

If you guess wrong, your score will be lowered by the number of letters!!!
